John Rodriguez, This was really hard. Probably went through alot free trial Api hosts, kept doing too many calls.
These test/projects , use them as time to learn and try things out as always, played with animations alot. Decided on the Pokemon API
its super free! In my code theres alot of edits. Even looped through Api pages, made it too complicated and started over many times.
There are questions in my code that I would like answered at some point. One is on object into a array, the other is a syntax .
